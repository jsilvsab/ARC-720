Context

Acme Insurance’s strategic goals (from the motivation diagram) include:
	•	Revenue Increase → Enable new sales channels, aggregator access.
	•	Cost Reduction → Reduce IT operations overhead, standardize systems.
	•	Customer Self-Service → Provide digital access without IT bottlenecks.
	•	IT System Standardization → Align with corporate IT, prefer COTS, reuse existing software when possible.

Technical landscape:
	•	Multiple legacy systems (claims, rating engine) hosted on-premises.
	•	Corporate IT favors managed services to reduce infra footprint.
	•	APIs will need secure hybrid connectivity to on-premises data sources during transition.
	•	Time-to-market is critical — new capabilities must roll out quickly with minimal operational friction.

Decision

We will deploy all new APIs and integrations to CloudHub 2.0 in the MuleSoft Anypoint Platform, with hybrid connectivity to on-premises systems via VPN or MuleSoft VPC Peering.

Key aspects:
	1.	Primary runtime → CloudHub 2.0 for production and non-production workloads.
	2.	Hybrid connectivity to legacy systems for data access until COTS replacements are live.
	3.	Zero-downtime rolling deployments via CH2 for faster iteration and release cadence.
	4.	Governance integration with Anypoint API Governance and Anypoint Monitoring.
	5.	Standardized deployment pipeline via CI/CD for all environments.

⸻

Rationale
	•	Time-to-market: CH2 is fully managed with Kubernetes-based pods, reducing infra setup time and enabling rapid scaling.
	•	Cost reduction: Eliminates need for Acme to maintain complex on-prem Mule clusters (RTF/standalone).
	•	Standardization: Centralized policies, logging, and deployment processes align with corporate IT requirements.
	•	Scalability: CH2 supports both horizontal and vertical scaling natively.
	•	Security: Enforced API Manager policies and VPC isolation in CH2 ensure compliance.

⸻

Consequences

Positive:
	•	Minimal IT operations effort.
	•	Consistent deployment process across all environments.
	•	Easy integration with API Governance for compliance checks.
	•	Rapid onboarding of new projects.

Negative/Trade-offs:
	•	Some workloads that require deep OS/network customization cannot run in CH2 (would require RTF or on-prem fallback).
	•	Reliance on MuleSoft’s managed infrastructure (vendor lock-in).
	•	Latency to on-prem systems mitigated but not eliminated via VPN/peering.

⸻

Alternatives Considered
	1.	Runtime Fabric (RTF) – Rejected for now due to higher infra management needs and no immediate requirement for full control/customization.
	2.	On-Premise Mule Runtimes – Rejected due to high operational overhead and slower release cadence.
	3.	Hybrid CH2 + RTF – Considered for the future if regulatory changes require on-prem processing for specific workloads.
